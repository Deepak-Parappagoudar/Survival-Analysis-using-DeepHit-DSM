# Survival-Analysis-using-DeepHit & DeepSurv

This project was part of my Machine Learninng & Data Analytics Seminar at FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg.
There are several steps involved in securing a loan, from application to approval. We try to predict how long an application survives, in other words, the time duration for an application to be accpeted or rejected. 

Nomenclature:


Survival Analysis: Survival analysis is a statistical method that deals with data where the outcome is the time until an event of interest occurs. This event can be death, disease progression, or any other event of interest. Survival analysis can be used to estimate the probability of survival for a given individual or group, and to identify factors that are associated with survival.


DeepHit: DeepHit is a deep learning model for survival analysis. DeepHit is able to learn complex relationships between the features and the time to event, and can therefore make more accurate predictions than traditional statistical methods. DeepHit has been shown to be effective in a variety of survival analysis tasks, including cancer prognosis and clinical trial outcome prediction.

Dataset: The BPIC 2017 dataset is a real-life event log dataset that was collected from a loan application process of a Dutch financial institute. The dataset contains information about the customers who applied for a loan, the events that occurred during the application process, and the outcome of the application (whether the loan was approved or rejected).


The BPIC 2017 dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in studying business process mining and survival analysis. The dataset can be used to train and evaluate machine learning models for predicting the outcome of loan applications, and to identify factors that are associated with loan approval or rejection.

Here are some of the key features of the BPIC 2017 dataset:

The dataset contains information about 80,000 loan applications.


The dataset includes 146 event types.



The dataset includes the outcome of the loan application (approved or rejected).


The dataset is avaialable at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waquarhaseeb/bpi-challenge-2017-dataset .
